## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1-alpha] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- Frontmatter compliance pass on both skills (`convention`, `patterns`): split the long trigger-phrase prose out of `description` into a `when_to_use` field, added `allowed-tools` declarations covering each skill's directive tool invocations, and added `disable-model-invocation: true` to `convention` (which directs `Write` to the project). No behavioral change.

## [1.0.0-alpha] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- `/iceberg:convention` skill with three modes:
  - **Author mode**: applies the iceberg asymmetric-complexity convention while writing code; keeps public interfaces stable, pushes complexity inward
  - **Audit mode**: reviews an existing codebase for structural debt that violates the convention; produces a prioritized finding list with concrete remediation steps
  - **Bootstrap mode**: scaffolds enforcement infrastructure in a fresh project (linter config, CI gates, ADR template)
- `/iceberg:patterns` skill: identifies recurring structural patterns in a codebase and evaluates them against the iceberg convention
- Language-agnostic: rules describe patterns; Claude translates each to the idiomatic enforcer for the detected ecosystem
- Template assets: ADR adoption record (`ADR-0001-adopt-iceberg-convention.md`), CLAUDE.md fragment for rule injection, PR template, generic ADR template
- 6 reference files covering convention rules, anti-patterns, enforcement patterns, and per-mode procedures
