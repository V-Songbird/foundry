# Flow 9: mechanical enforcement of overrides.pinned and overrides.protected_guards.
# The reflection agent is instructed to respect them, but that's honor-system.
# sync-finalize enforces both at the file level: pinned values always win over
# whatever reflection wrote; protected guards are restored from the pre-sync
# snapshot if reflection removed them.
