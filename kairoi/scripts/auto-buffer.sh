# kairoi PostToolUse hook: after ANY git commit succeeds, automatically
# append a buffer entry for it. Every commit is buffered unconditionally;
# reflection (dispatched separately on auto-sync triggers) classifies tasks
# as SUCCESS or BLOCKED from test results and other signals.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Fires PostToolUse on Bash for commit-creating git commands
#      (commit / revert / cherry-pick — see the gate below).
#   2. Exits silently if not in a kairoi-tracked project.
#   3. If the commit's hash already appears in buffer.jsonl, skip (dedup).
#   4. Reads FULL commit message (%B, not %s) — subject for task_id,
#      body available to reflection for text-heuristic BLOCKED detection.
#   5. Derives task_id from the conventional-commit subject's description.
#   6. Invokes buffer-append.sh; buffer-append auto-runs the configured
#      test command from `build-adapter.json.test` if set, else leaves
#      `test_results` null.

# JSON object; emitting two would invalidate the JSON and silently drop
# both):
#
#   A) Test/build failure on the just-buffered entry. buffer-append already
#      auto-promoted STATUS to BLOCKED and filled blocked_diagnostics from
#      the test output — but its stdout is /dev/null'd above, so Claude
#      never saw the failure. We re-read the just-written entry to surface
#      the failure as a system-reminder.
#
#   B) Buffer-threshold reached. Same dispatch signal as before — telling
#      Claude to invoke the kairoi-complete agent for batch reflection.
#
# Hooks can't dispatch subagents directly; they can only inject context.
# PostToolUse MUST emit JSON with hookSpecificOutput containing BOTH
# hookEventName and additionalContext fields for the message to reach the
# model. Raw stdout from PostToolUse is dropped.
