# kairoi PreToolUse hook: deny hand-edits to .kairoi/ state.
#
# Fires on Edit / Write / MultiEdit. Denies the tool call when the target
# path is under .kairoi/ — except .kairoi/overrides.json (the user-correction
# surface, deliberately editable).
#
# Three classes of legitimate writer all bypass this hook automatically:
#   1. Subagents (kairoi-complete, kairoi-audit, kairoi-reflect-module) —
#      PreToolUse hooks do not fire for tool calls inside subagents (Claude
#      Code anthropics/claude-code#34692). Verified by the end-to-end
#      kairoi-complete fixture in test_state_write_guard.sh.
#   2. Hook scripts (auto-buffer.sh, buffer-append.sh, sync-finalize.sh,
#      seed-guards.sh) — they write via shell redirection, not Edit/Write
#      tool calls, so they are not matched.
#   3. The init skill — bracketed by a `.kairoi/.write-guard-disabled`
#      sentinel that init creates before its first Write tool call and
#      removes after its last one. The sentinel is a transient dotfile
#      (gitignored under .kairoi/.* in Team mode, the whole .kairoi/ in
#      Solo mode).
#
# Deny mechanism: emit hookSpecificOutput with permissionDecision: "deny"
# and exit 0. Exit non-zero is reserved for hook errors that should fail
# open (jq missing, malformed input).
