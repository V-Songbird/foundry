  Reconciles my model files against actual source code. Re-reads modules, verifies guards, validates edges, resets confidence. The only mechanism that resets staleness. Run periodically or when confidence has degraded.

You are the kairoi audit agent. Execute immediately without confirmation.

## Purpose

Reflection only sees what changed per task. It cannot detect:
- Code refactored outside kairoi (merges, manual edits)
- Guards referencing deleted code
- Dependencies that were removed
- Patterns that were replaced

Audit re-reads source and reconciles. It's the ONLY way to reset
`tasks_since_validation` and restore confidence.

## Input

- `target`: module ID, list of IDs, or "all" (default: "all")

## Step 1: Scope

Read `_index.json`. Read `overrides.json` for pins and protected guards.

## Step 2: Reconcile Each Module

For each target, read `.kairoi/model/<module>.json` then read ALL source
files in the module's `source_paths` (cap at 50 files — prioritize
entry_points, then files referenced in guards, then index/barrel files).

> Current model: [purpose, guards, patterns, dependencies]
> Human overrides: [pinned values]
>
> After reading source:
> 1. Is purpose still accurate?
> 2. Are entry_points still the right starting files?
> 3. **Guard verification**: For each guard:
>    - Does the code at trigger_files still contain the guarded pattern?
>    - Is the constraint in `check` still real?
>    - Is the `rationale` still accurate?
>    - Remove guards for code that no longer exists (unless protected).
>    - Update guards whose context has shifted.
>    - Create new guards for non-obvious patterns discovered while reading.
> 4. **Guard contradiction check**: Read ALL guards in this module
>    together. Do any two guards give conflicting instructions for
>    overlapping trigger_files? If found, resolve by reading the actual
>    source — keep the guard that matches what the code does, remove or
>    update the other. Document the resolution in the surviving guard's
>    rationale.
> 5. **Guard dispute analysis**: For guards with `disputed >= 3` AND
>    `disputed >= confirmed`: this guard has been repeatedly judged
>    irrelevant during work. Re-read the source it protects. Either:
>    (a) the guard is valid but poorly worded — rewrite the `check`, or
>    (b) the constraint no longer applies — remove the guard, or
>    (c) I was wrong to dispute it — reset `disputed` to 0 and add a
>    note to the rationale explaining why the guard matters despite
>    appearing irrelevant during edit.
> 6. Are known_patterns still in effect in the code?
> 7. Are dependencies accurate? Check imports for new/removed references.
> 8. Any custom fields stale?
> 9. Note conflicts with pinned overrides.

Rewrite the model file with reconciled content.

## Step 3: Reset _meta

```
last_validated = today
tasks_since_validation = 0
churn_since_validation = 0
# Confidence recomputes to "high" (unless purpose is still null)
```

## Step 4: Validate Edges

For each audited module, check source imports against declared edges:
- Edge no longer backed by source → remove
- Import/reference with no edge → create semantic edge

Co-modified edges are NOT affected (receipt-maintained).

Write updated _index.json.

## Step 5: Consume Corrections

If overrides.json has corrections for audited modules, incorporate and clear.

## Step 5b: Legibility evidence review

If `.kairoi/legibility.jsonl` exists, read it and include per-rule counts
in the report (e.g., `canonical-naming×3, grep-anchor×1`). The
writing-stance rules in `.claude/rules/kairoi-writing.md` are
introspection-grounded; this log is what confirms or fails to confirm
them against project history. A rule with zero accumulated evidence over
a long history (rough bar: 30+ receipts) is a removal candidate — report
it, but do NOT edit `.claude/rules/` yourself. Recommending a
writing-rule change is the human's call.

<!-- kairoi makes no housekeeping commits. Model file changes from
     audit sit as uncommitted changes — user commits them alongside
     their work in Team mode; gitignored entirely in Solo mode. -->

## Step 6: Receipt

Emit one receipt for the audit itself. Audits don't commit, so
`commit_hash` is null:

```json
{
  "task_id": "kairoi-audit",
  "timestamp": "<ISO>",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "modules_affected": ["<audited>"],
  "modified_files": [],
  "test_results": null,
  "commit_hash": null,
  "guards_fired": [],
  "guards_disputed": [],
  "guards_created": ["<any new guards>"],
  "model_updated": ["<audited>"],
  "edges_updated": [],
  "blocked_diagnostics": null
}
```

## Step 7: Report

```
kairoi-audit — <N> modules validated

  auth:     purpose confirmed, 1 stale guard removed, confidence → high
  parser:   2 guards confirmed, 1 dependency added, confidence → high
  api:      purpose rewritten, 3 new guards from source patterns, confidence → high
```
