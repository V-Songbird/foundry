# Audit kairoi models

Dispatch the `kairoi-audit` subagent to reconcile models against
source code.

Target: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to "all")

## When to run

- Session boot shows modules with `low` confidence
- After merges, manual edits, or external contributions
- Periodically (~every 20-30 tasks)
- When guards seem wrong during work

## Invoke

MUST invoke `Agent` with:

```
subagent_type: "kairoi-audit"
name: "kairoi-audit"
description: "Audit kairoi models"
prompt: "Reconcile kairoi model files against source code. Target: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to 'all' if empty). Follow the kairoi-audit agent's Steps 1–7."
max_turns: 25
run_in_background: false
```

The `kairoi-audit` subagent is resolved by `subagent_type` name; its
definition lives under the plugin's `agents/` directory and declares
`maxTurns: 25`. The explicit `max_turns: 25` above matches that value
so the runtime does not default to a smaller budget.
`run_in_background: false` because the user expects to see the audit
report inline in the same turn that invoked `/kairoi:audit`.
