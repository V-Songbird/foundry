# kairoi doctor

Validate structural integrity of `.kairoi/` state files.

MUST invoke `Bash` with:
- `command: '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/doctor.sh'`
- `description: 'Validating kairoi state integrity'`
- `timeout: 30000`

On first surfacing, present the script's stdout to the user without
paraphrasing, summarizing, or reformatting — echo each line as it was
emitted. Each failing check's line includes the recovery action; those
action lines must not be suppressed or rewritten. (If the user then
asks a follow-up like "which of those should I fix first?", answer in
prose — the verbatim mandate applies only to the initial surfacing.)

This performs structural checks only — no semantic analysis. For
verifying that models accurately reflect source code, use
`/kairoi:audit` instead.

**Checks performed**:
- JSON/JSONL file validity
- Module files match _index.json registry
- Guard fields (trigger_files, source_task, check)
- Guard trigger paths still exist on disk (rename detection — a guard
  whose every trigger path is gone can never fire again)
- Edge references point to existing modules
- _meta fields have valid values
- build-adapter.json test command is executable
- Transient files are covered by .gitignore
