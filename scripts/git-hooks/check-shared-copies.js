// CONTRIBUTING.md's "no shared runtime between plugins" rule means a plugin
// cannot require() a file out of a sibling: each is installed from its own
// independent repo, with no guarantee this monorepo is on disk. So the few
// genuinely shared helpers ship as a verbatim copy per plugin.
//
// The half a human reviewer cannot hold: a copy only drifts once, quietly,
// in whichever plugin was not the one being fixed. safe-write.js drifted
// twice that way -- the trusted-roots block, then the whole-path realpath --
// and both times the stale copy was the one that skipped a security check,
// while its own header still promised the copies were identical.
//
// A missing plugin checkout is not drift: submodules are not always
// initialized, so an absent file is skipped rather than failed.
//
