// Two independent triggers, since a task stops getting any nudge the moment
// it's marked done — real usage showed a same-day follow-up bugfix commit
// (found right after finishing a task, before moving on) silently loses its
// SHA with no signal at all, unlike an in_progress task which still nudges.
// Passing commit also auto-folds that commit's actual changed files into
// touches (roadmap.js runs `git show` itself) — touches is set once, from
// whatever investigation happened before the task started, and nothing
// updates it once real work reveals a wider (or different) footprint.
// add_touches remains for the rare case that needs it (git unavailable, or
// a file touched outside this specific commit) but doesn't need mentioning
// here — passing commit alone already covers the common case.
//
// requireVerification decouples "record the work" from "call it done": data
// (commit/touches) is never worth gating on a human, only the status label
// is — so under the flag, the in_progress branch still records immediately
// but leaves status alone until the user actually confirms it.
