# Public docs: READMEs and CHANGELOGs

These files are read by end users of the plugins. Every line must help a user decide or act — nothing else earns a place.

- When writing any line in a `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`, state the **user-visible** effect — "Cuts tool-output noise", never "arm C3 scored 0.2 across 200 runs". Never document internal process there — benchmark methodology, run tags, sample sizes, per-rep numbers, A/B setups, transcript quotes, investigation narratives — write that to private memory instead.
- When adding a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, write it short and user-facing — "Fixed an issue where sidecar digests miscounted lines", "Added…" — a few lines at most. State the effect, never the journey ("After three batches we traced it to…"): no design rationale, no lessons learned, no wording-choice commentary.
- When editing a `README.md`, describe **current** behavior only. Delete a historical line like "used to leak tokens, now fixed" rather than keeping it as a caveat. Once an issue is resolved, remove every mention from `README.md`; `CHANGELOG.md` is the record of the past.
- When a release fixes a limitation, delete its caveat from `README.md` in that same release — never soften "broken on Windows" to "mostly works on Windows". A caveat stays only while the limitation is real, current, and user-relevant.
- **Competitor and reference-project names may appear only in a plugin's `README.md`** — that's the marketing surface, and naming a rival to beat it ("beating the giants") is fair game there. Nowhere else: not CHANGELOGs, manifests, code comments, test names and fixtures, branch names, PR text, or **git commit messages** (subject and body), across the root repo and every submodule. Outside a README, contrast with a generic category ("a rival tool", "a public reference") instead. The names live in gitignored private notes (`docs/research/`); a pre-commit + commit-msg hook (`scripts/git-hooks/check-reference-names.js`, blocklist gitignored, fail-open when absent) enforces this mechanically — its staged-change scan skips `README.md` files and it always blocks commit messages.
- Match the canonical skeleton/voice in `.github/PLUGIN_README_TEMPLATE.md` — warm, plain-spoken, and lightly funny (friendly, not corporate hype). Lead with the answer, keep sentences short, explain any needed term in plain words in the same sentence, and give the concrete number over the abstract claim; the template carries a synthetic voice exemplar to calibrate against. Two non-negotiables: no profanity, and never make the joke at a real project's or person's expense — naming a rival to out-compete it is fine, belittling it is not. razor and hush are the reference implementations.
- For a callout that needs visual weight (an honest limitation, a non-destructive guarantee, a cost caveat), use GitHub's alert syntax — `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]` — instead of an italic aside. Pick the type by actual stakes: NOTE/TIP for helpful context, IMPORTANT for something the user needs to succeed, WARNING/CAUTION for real risk. Don't reach for WARNING or CAUTION to manufacture urgency a NOTE would cover. Use one or two per file, not one per paragraph.
