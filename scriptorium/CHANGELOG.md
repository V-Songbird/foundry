## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1-alpha] — 2026-05-07

### Changed

- `proofreader` item 8a now measures the **combined** `description` + `when_to_use` length against the 1,536-char cap (the actual upstream truncation unit in the skill listing), not `description` alone — a 1,000-char `description` plus a 1,000-char `when_to_use` no longer slips past the audit
- `scribe` item 8 and the body-budget table updated to match (combined-cap wording, source pointer to `references/skill-authoring.md` § 3)

### Added

- `proofreader` item 11 sub-rule: `description` says both *what* and *when* — partial fail when neither field anchors the trigger condition (per upstream "What the skill does and when to use it")
- `proofreader` item 11 sub-rule: front-loading the key use case — advisory `Suggest:` annotation emitted in Evidence when the first sentence buries the dominant trigger noun (per upstream "Put the key use case first"); explicitly excluded from verdict math and partial-fail tally
- Item 11 Output-format Evidence template extended with worked phrasings for both new sub-rules

## [1.0.0-alpha] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- `/scriptorium:scribe` skill: comprehensive authoring guide for Claude Code instruction artifacts (SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, plan files, subagent definitions, slash commands, hook scripts); covers every tool parameter, phrasing pattern, frontmatter field, and decomposition shape that Claude Code parses and executes reliably
- 13-item authoring checklist covering: `AskUserQuestion` full shape, `TodoWrite`/`TaskCreate`+`TaskUpdate` lifecycle, `Bash` description field, `Agent` dispatch parameters, plan-gate `ExitPlanMode` usage, no `AskUserQuestion` inside subagents, literal tool names with strong directive verbs, `SKILL.md` body shape and token budget, file reference resolution, user-facing output phrasing, frontmatter validity, decomposition opportunity (SUGGEST-only), and dynamic-injection safety
- `proofreader` subagent: audits any instruction artifact against the 13-item checklist; returns a structured PASS/FAIL/N/A/SUGGEST report per item with line-anchored evidence and concrete revision text
- Directory-mode cross-file pattern detection: flags the same checklist failure repeated across ≥ 3 files as a single systemic entry
- Decomposition guidance: identifies SKILL.md files that should be split into orchestrator + subagents; provides proposed file-tree output
- Dynamic-injection safety check: flags write-shaped commands in `` !`cmd` `` and ` ```! ` blocks that run unconditionally
- 12 reference files covering tools, workflow shapes, plans, hooks, permissions, dynamic context, agent frontmatter, key bindings, and decomposition patterns
- 6 worked examples: strong CLAUDE.md, plan file, SKILL.md, subagent definition, workflow decomposition, and a full worked example walkthrough
