  Shared CONTRIBUTING.md template for standalone plugin repos.

  to fill — the content is written to apply to any plugin with Claude and Codex editions as-is.
  A single-package plugin such as Foreman (Foundry ADR 0011) or Razor (Foundry ADR 0013) keeps this text and adds a
  plugin-specific section for its two manifests, hooks/codex-hooks.json and the version it
  bumps in both manifests, which replaces the version notes below. Hush (Foundry ADR 0012)
  adds the same kind of section for its single Claude Code manifest.

# Contributing

This plugin is part of the [Foundry Collection](https://github.com/V-Songbird/foundry) and is maintained by a single author. Contributions are welcome in the form of bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests.

## Before opening a PR

- Check existing issues first — the problem may already be tracked or intentionally deferred.
- For substantial changes (new skills, significant refactors), open an issue first to align on direction before writing code.

```

└── plugin.json        # name, description, author, keywords — NO version
                        # field (the version is owned by foundry's
                        # .claude-plugin/marketplace.json)
CHANGELOG.md            # dated entries, newest first
LICENSE                 # MIT
README.md               # plain-language intro first, technical depth after

```

Every README shares one skeleton, tone, and style, defined in foundry's [`.github/PLUGIN_README_TEMPLATE.md`](https://github.com/V-Songbird/foundry/blob/main/.github/PLUGIN_README_TEMPLATE.md).

## What to keep in mind

**Skills are Claude-facing instruction files.** Changes to `SKILL.md` affect how Claude interprets a skill — be precise, and test manually by invoking the affected skill in a real session before submitting.

**Hooks are scripts that run on every tool call or session event.** Keep them fast (no network, no blocking I/O) and test on both Unix and Windows.

---

## Tests

If this plugin has scripted behavior, run its tests before submitting:

```
node --test tests/*.test.js
```

PRs that change script behavior without updating tests will not be merged.

---

## Git hooks

Run this once after cloning:

```
git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks
```

This enables a `pre-commit` hook that runs `node --test tests/*.test.js` and blocks the commit on failure. It no-ops if this plugin has no `tests/` directory.

---

## Changelog

Add a dated entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` for every user-visible change. Version bumps and marketplace listing changes happen in [foundry](https://github.com/V-Songbird/foundry), not here.
