> **TL;DR** — foreman keeps your project plan alive between sessions. hush cuts the chatter and the cost. razor stops code nobody needed. All three are available for Claude Code; Foreman and Razor also support Codex.

---

## New here?

[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) is Anthropic's AI coding assistant. **Plugins** extend it: they teach Claude new habits, add guardrails, or change how it behaves. One-line install, no setup.

This is a small, hand-picked collection. Each plugin does one job well and works on its own.

## Install

Inside Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add V-Songbird/foundry
/plugin install <plugin-name>@foundry
```

The first command registers this collection — you only do it once. The second installs whichever plugin you want. Changed your mind? `/plugin uninstall <plugin-name>@foundry` and it's gone.

### Codex

Foreman and Razor have Codex versions. Run:

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace add V-Songbird/foundry
codex plugin add foreman@foundry
codex plugin add razor@foundry
```

The Codex catalog is [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](.agents/plugins/marketplace.json).
Both platforms use the name `foundry` and select their own catalog. Each catalog
installs from the plugin repository's platform branch at a pinned revision.
Open a new Codex task after installation to load the installed skills and hooks.
Hush for Codex is not available yet.

## The plugins

### [foreman](https://github.com/V-Songbird/foreman) — Your plan survives the session

Every Claude Code session forgets everything when it ends. Foreman keeps your plan in the repo, committed like code. Ask "what's next?" and you get the recommended task, the reason it's first, and a ready-to-run prompt whose paths were checked against your code. After each commit, it spots the task that looks finished and asks before checking it off.

```
/plugin install foreman@foundry
```

### [hush](https://github.com/V-Songbird/hush) — Less chatter, lower cost

Claude bills you for every word it says while it works — narration, previews, walls of command output. hush trims that bulk at the source, before it hits your bill. You get silence while it works, then one clear answer-first summary at the end. Big output is saved whole to a local file before it's shortened, so nothing is lost.

```
/plugin install hush@foundry
```

### [razor](https://github.com/V-Songbird/razor) — Stops Claude from over-building

AI assistants love to add: a new library here, five helper files there, an abstraction "for later." razor makes Claude run a short checklist first — is it needed, does it already exist, does the platform do it for free? The first reach for a new dependency gets one challenge, with your project's declared-dependency list right in the message. Never a hard block — always one forced second thought.

```
/plugin install razor@foundry
```

### Which one first?

| You want to… | Install |
| --- | --- |
| Keep a project plan that outlives the session | **foreman** |
| Cut token cost and noise | **hush** |
| Keep the codebase lean | **razor** |

hush and razor are natural partners: hush governs how Claude *talks*, razor governs what it *builds*.

## Repository layout

```
foundry/
├── flint/
├── foreman/
├── hush/
└── razor/
```

Every plugin lives in its own repo, mounted here as a git submodule (see [`.gitmodules`](.gitmodules)), and carries its own `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md`. The root copies of the community files govern contributions to this marketplace repo itself. The Claude Code catalog is [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json); it owns the Claude release versions and pins each source revision. Codex versions live in each plugin's `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, with their own catalog at [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](.agents/plugins/marketplace.json).

Foundry itself uses only `main`. Each plugin has three branches: `main` is its
front page, `Claude` contains the Claude Code plugin, and `Codex` contains the
Codex version or its unpublished development entry point. The catalogs choose
the platform branch explicitly; the submodule checkout does not select what
users install. Hush stays outside the Codex catalog until its port is validated.

[`flint/`](https://github.com/V-Songbird/flint) is mounted the same way but is not a plugin and is not in the marketplace. It is plain text — hush's writing voice and razor's cut-before-adding rules as files you paste into a session with nothing installed. It has no `plugin.json`, no version, and no marketplace entry.

## Development

Run this once after cloning, to switch on the commit gates:

```
git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks
```

`.claude/settings.json` (committed) registers three repo-wide dev hooks. All are dev-only. None fire for anyone who merely *installed* a plugin from this repo — only for work done inside the source tree itself:

- `.claude/hooks/run-tests-on-edit.js` reruns a plugin's own test suite after an `Edit`/`Write` lands in that plugin's `scripts/` or `hooks/` dir. It finds the right suite by walking up to the nearest `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` marker, so it works for any plugin here. Silent when green; it surfaces a failure when red.
- `.claude/hooks/nudge-manifest-curator.js` nudges a follow-up `manifest-curator` audit after an edit lands in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` or any plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Manifest edits are easy to get subtly wrong, so the reminder earns its keep.
- `.claude/hooks/check-checkpoint-commits.js` watches `Bash`/`PowerShell` calls for a `git commit` whose message reads like a per-step checkpoint (`task 3/7: …`) and reminds you that checkpoints belong on a branch, squash-merged back into one real commit before you report the work done.

Tests, for a plugin that has them:

```
node --test <plugin>/tests/*.test.js
```
