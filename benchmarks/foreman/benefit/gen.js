// Does a CORRECT lesson change the outcome?
//
// P2 answered the safety half — a stale lesson that says it might be stale
// does not hurt — but it could never answer the benefit half. Its control
// arm was already 100% correct, so a right lesson had no room to help. A
// benefit measurement needs a task the session gets WRONG without the lesson.
//
// The fixture is `pinned-dup`: the `adjacent-mess` module with the ticket that
// pins its three copy-pasted percentile helpers removed from everywhere. Not
// the code comment, not the brief, not the prompt. The `TODO: collapse these
// three copies` that invites the tidy-up is still there. So a session with no
// lesson has every reason to unify them and nothing telling it not to.
//
//   arm         the lesson block
//   ---         ----------------
//   pin-off     none at all — the control, which cannot know about the pin
//   pin-on      the pin, recorded by an earlier close, labelled unchanged
//   pin-wrong   a DIFFERENT pin, same shape and same fresh label, that is
//               false of the code — the mirror question
//
// The mirror question is what a wrong lesson costs. `pin-on` proved a correct
// lesson moves correctness from nothing to everything, so the same channel has
// to be assumed to carry a wrong one just as hard. Nothing detects this case:
// the staleness resolver answers "have the files changed", never "was the
// claim ever true", so a false lesson whose files sit still is served as fresh
// forever.
//
// `pin-wrong` pins the one thing the task exists to change. It is the same
// sentence pattern, the same position, the same `unchanged since` label and
// the same correct path match as `pin-on` — the only difference is that it is
// false. If a served lesson can talk a session out of the fix it was sent to
// make, the shipped suite fails and the runner scores it. If it cannot, the
// cost is whatever the session spends adjudicating the claim.
//
// The three helpers' distinguishing lines are pinned as `sentinels` in
// tasks.json, so collapsing them is caught however it is done — one shared
// helper, three thin delegates, anything. `fixtures/pinned-dup/lazy/` is that
// exact tidy-up and selfcheck runs it every time, which keeps the detector
// honest without spending a session on it.
//
// Read the result the way the design demands: if the CONTROL never unifies,
// the lesson has no room to help and the benefit half stays unmeasured. That is a
// real answer, and it costs three control runs to get.
//
// Header and closer are read from the plugin, never restated here — a reworded
// product string must fail the arm test rather than silently benchmark prose
// the product no longer ships.
//
// Two more pairs ride on the same machinery. `chain-off` / `chain-on` ask
// whether the symbol chain — the block craft-handoff.js builds from a file's
// commit history — carries the same pin as well as a lesson does. `unpin-off`
// / `unpin-wrong` ask the question the wrong-lesson arm could not: what a
// false lesson does when NOTHING in the task can refute it. They run as the
// `unpinned-dup` task — pinned-dup's own fixture with the opposite truth (the
// collapse is the job, so its `lazy` overlay is the solution) — and serve
// pin-on's exact block anyway.
