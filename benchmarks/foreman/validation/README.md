# Result records

Every public performance claim Foreman makes has to be backed by a record in
this format. A record is the evidence behind one sentence: the exact fixtures
and prompts it was measured with, the model and its settings, how many times it
ran, every individual run, the aggregate with its statistic named, the date,
the machine, and the things the number does *not* say.

A claim with no record does not ship. Not softened, not asterisked — it either
gets a record or it stops being a claim. The format, validator and measurement harness are maintained centrally in
Foundry. Keep records with their original evidence and follow the collection's
research publication policy.

## The rules

**One record, one claim.** The `claim` field is the sentence, verbatim, that
the record is allowed to support. If you find yourself wanting to stretch it,
you want a second record.

**Records are immutable.** A published record is never edited. If it was wrong,
or the world moved, publish a *new* record whose `supersedes` names the old id.
The old file stays where it is — a correction that erases what it corrects is
not a correction.

**The id is the filename.** `R-001-prompt-overhead.json` has the id
`R-001-prompt-overhead`. Nothing to keep in sync.

**Nothing is backfilled.** A record describes a run that happened. There is no
legitimate reason to write one from an estimate, an extrapolation, a
remembered number, or a chart. If the run's output is gone, the claim is gone.

## Validate

Run from the Foundry root; pass --records to select a retained record directory.

```bash
node benchmarks/foreman/validation/validate-records.js
```

Free, deterministic, no model call. It checks every record for the required
fields and their types, that `limitations` is non-empty, that every fixture and
prompt it names still exists **and still hashes to the bytes it was measured
against**, that `date` is a real ISO date, that `aggregate.statistic` says what
kind of average it is, that `runs` has as many entries as `repetitions` claims,
and that a `supersedes` pointer resolves. One JSON object on stdout; non-zero
exit if any record is invalid. `--records <dir>` points it elsewhere.

The hash check is the load-bearing one: it means a fixture cannot be edited out
from under a claim quietly. Change `prompt-template.md` and the record measured
against the old one fails, loudly, instead of going on supporting a sentence in
the README. A superseded record is the one exemption: it stays on file as
history with every field still validated, but only its successor answers for
today's bytes.

## Schema

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claim` | string | The exact sentence this record supports. |
| `fixtures` | array | `{path, sha256, role?}` — repo-relative, hashed. Everything the run read. |
| `prompts` | array | `{path, sha256}` or `{text}` — the exact prompt(s) sent. `[]` when no model ran. |
| `model` | object or `null` | `{id, settings}` — settings carry temperature, reasoning effort, and anything else that changes the answer. `null` means no model ran. |
| `repetitions` | integer ≥ 1 | How many times it ran. Must equal `runs.length`. |
| `runs` | array | One entry per repetition, with that repetition's own numbers. Per-run results are not optional: an aggregate without its spread hides the thing a reader needs most. |
| `aggregate` | object | `{statistic, values}`. `statistic` names what kind of average it is — a bare number is not a result. |
| `date` | string | `YYYY-MM-DD`, the day it ran. |
| `environment` | object | `{os, node, foreman_commit}`. |
| `limitations` | array of strings | Non-empty. What this number does not establish. |
| `supersedes` | string | Optional. The id of the record this one replaces. |
| `command` | string | Optional but expected — the command that reproduces it. |

### `model: null`

A mechanical fact recomputed on demand from files in the repository — the
prompt-overhead ratio, for instance — is recorded with `model: null`,
`repetitions: 1`, and a limitation stating plainly that it is a static
computation and not a model trial. It is reproducible and it is honest, but it
is a different kind of evidence from a session that actually ran, and the
record has to say so rather than letting the two look alike.

## Where the data lives

Record files land in this directory but are not committed — they are the
operator's local audit trail. The harness lives in the marketplace repo under
`benchmarks/foreman/`; it drives real sessions and reads real costs out of the
API, so any figure can be regenerated from scratch.
